                  <h3>Itroduction</h3>
                  <br>
                <p> In 2015 I joined the Air force, a month later I shipped out and a few months after that I moved to place, I now call home. It was not the first time in my life
                  that I relocated permanently but this time it felt different. I felt I had a purpose. 5 years later and I am still here in Fairfield, California. Born and raised in Mexico and then moving on to Pennsylvania has given me
                  the opportunity to meet a lot of different people. I intend to continue my tradition of moving on around every 8 years and live in North Carolina in a few years. I have a wife and kid, who mean the world to me,
                  and I love exploring the world around us with them. In order to make a living I plan on doing a few things, first is to get my B.S in Business admin and then receive a masters after that. During my masters, hopefully
                  in N.C, I want to start a Real Estate investments company and then move one to bigger and better things. <p>
