                    In 2015 I joined the Air force, a month later I shipped out and a few months after that I moved to the place I now call home, California. It was not the first time in my life that I relocated permanently but this time it felt different. I felt I had a purpose. It was my big move as a wide-eyed 19-year-old kid who wanted to start something new.  6 years later and I am still here in Fairfield, California. Born and raised in Mexico and then moving on to Pennsylvania has given me the opportunity to meet a lot of different people. People whom I’ve connected with and build life-long friendships, those that no matter how far away we live from each other we will help each other out any way possible.

                     I intend to continue my tradition of moving thousands of miles every few years and move to North Carolina this next year, we will be living in the beautiful city of Charlotte.  I have a wife and kid and one on the way, who all mean the world to me. I love exploring the world around the US with them, seeing places that might be the first memory of my child at some point. While my family is my everything, I do have some professional goals as well. In order to make a living I plan on doing a few things. First is to get my B.S in Business admin and then receive a masters after that. During my masters, I want to start a Real Estate investments company and at some point, run my own diner.
