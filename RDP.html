                    <h1> My Real Estate Story: Red Door Properties</h1>
                    <p>I am thirty for knowledge. That is the reason why I don't just work 40 hours a week and finish there. I know that where I am is not where I want to be. To do that I realize that I need to be constantly learning. Learning coding for my associates, learning business for my bachelors and learning real estate for my career. I am not, nor do I pretend to be a master at sales, rehabs, number & market analysis and many more skills that I need to be a master at. Therefore, I need a teacher. Since my life does not permit me to attend additional classes about the science of real estate, I decided to take some privately own, pre-recorded live classes that will help me get my foot in the door while I finish my life in active duty. These classes are done by a private company named Renatus. They are classes taught by industry professionals. These are people that have been where I am, started from nothing and have decided to build their life up. There is over 100+ ~8hr long classes about different subjects in all subfields of RE investments. Never the less I have gotten started. I own Red Door Properties here in California, I own 1 house and will turn it into my very first rental this upcoming year.
                    <br>
                    below is a 5-minute snippet of the introductory video to one of the set of classes.
